　　2020年的上半年，咱们看到了宏病毒的薄情，也看到尘世的大爱；看到了抗疫之中的顽固与害怕，更深沉地感遭到了咱们爱国与结合的力气。咱们断定，体验过的咱们必定是不卑鄙的，咱们一腔热血、理念目的里必然充溢了家国情怀！咱们越发深信，体验过如许一场疫情的华夏，只会越发宏大！
　　一如披上一件烟雾似纱巾的橡树叶，被银色化过妆的小草，还有池塘里泛着淡淡微笑的水正陪伴我痴迷地聆听欣赏。
　　记得，由于妹妹临近放假，于是，母亲决定提前替妹妹将手风琴从学校带回家中，并安排我于当日下午五点在小镇门口接她。未曾料到，中午刚过，雨就来了。一直等着，等着，时间已近五点了，雨依旧没有停。于是，我只好穿上雨衣，带着伞，独自来到路边等候。
I may forget that moment, but I never forget the rolling of that kind of power.
This is my unexpected.
Once, how much I love ShuTing "to the oak".
"I must be a kapok beside you, / as the image of the tree stand together with you.
/ root, hold in the ground,, / / touched in the cloud."
By now, but I let oneself grow into a plant climbing vines.
Let themselves into his shoulder a heavy burden.
Listen to Rene sing "love love you very much, so willing to, to give you, to more happy place fly away."
I was so love him, love him more than love myself.
How I wish he were filled with full of was filled with joy and happiness.
If necessary, I even willing to exchange my life for him for the peace and well-being of the eternal.
But now, I only to see him after a day at work, dragged tired body home.
However, he was not like that.
Once upon a time, he has a pair of free flying wings, there are full of fight the sky lofty sentiments.
For him who is only such a door to walk between the sentient beings, humbly folding of the wings?
Is who let his feathers, full of CLS in day by day to rush about the bright color?
This is such a big irony, a preached loves his people, a full of hope he are higher and higher, it turns out to be a heavy burden on his wings, he fly to happiness.
